# Project Part 1 - Building a Basic Operating System

## Team Members
- Elian Esparza
- Jair Aguirre

## Project Overview
This project is the first part of a multi-part assignment to design and implement a simplified operating system simulator using C++. In this phase, we establish the project foundation by:
- Setting up a GitHub repository for collaborative development.
- Creating a basic program structure.
- Simulating the boot-up process.
- Implementing a simple authentication function (using hardcoded credentials).

## Features
- **Boot-Up Process:**  
  The program simulates an OS boot sequence by displaying startup messages with timed delays.
- **Authentication Function:**  
  The program prompts the user to enter a username and password. It then verifies the input against the hardcoded credentials (username: `admin`, password: `password123`) and displays a success or failure message.

## Setup and Running Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler that supports C++17.
- Git (for cloning the repository).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
